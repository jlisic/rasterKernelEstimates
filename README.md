Description: Performs kernel based estimates on in-memory raster images
  from the raster package.  These kernel estimates include local means
  variances, modes, medians, and Gaussian kernel density estimates.  All
  results are in the form of raster images, preserving original resolution
  and projection attributes in the raster image.
